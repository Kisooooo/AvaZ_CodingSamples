# AvaZ_CodingSamples
This repository contains Ava (Yecheng) Zhao's coding samples. Representative codes from 3 projects are included, as most of them are parts of larger projects or are collaborative.
The files are lightly documented and includes a brief heading explaining the purpose and structure of the code.
All code snippets are my own from 2023 and 2024.


## Projects (Separated by folders)
### M3 Mathematical Modeling Challenge
Includes code and materials I have written for my team's submission to the 2024 challenge.

The challenge focused on devising math models to extrapolate existing data and solve real-world problems. My task involved designing math models, cleaning and processing Excel data, executing statistical analyses, creating plots, and writing up a solution paper (section included as pdf).

The challenge had a time limit of 12 hours.

Languages/tools used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

### ExeterHWForum
Collaborated project completed in my school's course CSC590: Engineering Software Solutions.

Desciption: ExeterHWForum is a dynamic web application that serves as a forum for student-to-student and teacher discourse on schoolwork, with features like account creation, creating and commenting on posts, searching for specific topics using tags, and voting posts for popularity, aiming to create an interactive learning experience.

*Code samples are selected from parts that I was directly responsible for.*

Languages/tools used: PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XAMPP

### VAST Challenge for Data Visualization
Includes code snippets used in my team's submission to the 2023 challenge. 

My task involved processing and analyzing large datasets with Python and CSS, and creating a vast array of interactive visualizations, including circle packing diagrams, Umaps, jitter plots, and nodes-and-edges network graphs.

Languages/tools used: Python, D3.js, HTML, Pandas
